# Third-party notices

Soulcalibur II Recomp is GPL-3.0-or-later (`LICENSE`). It contains, builds on or ships the work below, each under
its own license. The full texts are in [docs/licenses](docs/licenses), and every release archive carries this file
and that folder.

Nothing of Soulcalibur II is in this repository or its releases' data: the player's own disc is read on their
machine, and the guests (Link, Heihachi) are converted there from the player's own GameCube and PlayStation 2
discs. The HD texture import (the Textures page) holds only a map of texture names (hashes), and reads the pack
the player downloaded themselves.

## In this repository

| What | License | Where, and what for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [recomp-common](https://github.com/tmcleroy/recomp-common) | GPL-3.0 | `recomp-common/`, a synced copy: the launcher, the in-game menu and the settings. Its launcher derives from the launcher of [wiiparty-recomp](https://github.com/arelkair/wiiparty-recomp) by arelkair (GPL-3.0-or-later), as its files say |
| musl's math (sin, cos, atan2, log2, expm1) | MIT ([docs/licenses/musl.txt](docs/licenses/musl.txt)) | `runtime/x87_math/`, so the game's x87 arithmetic gives the same results on every system |
| The online service | GPL-3.0-or-later | `online/`, from cps2recomp's `online/` (the same author) |
| [xxHash](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash) 0.8.2 (Yann Collet) | BSD-2-Clause ([xxHash.txt](docs/licenses/xxHash.txt)) | `third_party/doa2u-re/recomp-runtime/xxhash.h`: texture packs' names (the game) |

## Submodules

| What | License | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [doa2u-re](https://github.com/tmcleroy/doa2u-re) (branch `soulcalibur2-runtime`), NoRain211's DOA runtime (from doa3-re and doaxvb-re) | GPL-3.0-or-later (its `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`) | `third_party/doa2u-re`: the runtime the game runs on (kernel, Direct3D 8 on SDL_GPU, DirectSound, input). In every build |
| [xboxrecomp](https://github.com/NoRain211/xboxrecomp) (sp00nznet's, NoRain211's fork) | MIT (its `LICENSE`; its `NOTICE` lists files of its own under other licenses) | `tools/xboxrecomp`: the translator that turns the player's `Default.xbe` into C on their machine. Only its Python tools run (`tools.xbe_parser`, `tools.disasm`, `tools.recomp`); none of its code is built into the programs. Its `src/apu` and `src/nv2a/nv2a_regs.h` are LGPL-2.1 files from xemu that this project does not use |

## Used while developing (nothing of it here or in the releases)

- [Cxbx-Reloaded](https://github.com/Cxbx-Reloaded/Cxbx-Reloaded)'s XbSymbolDatabase: its signatures, read from a
  local checkout by `tools/xdk_symbols.py`, name the Xbox library functions in the player's executable.
- xemu, Cxbx-Reloaded and xboxdevwiki, as references for how the Xbox behaves.
